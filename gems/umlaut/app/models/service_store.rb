# A ServiceStore is a collection of umlaut service definitions, with identifiers. 
#
# There is one default global one that is typically used; originally this
# was all neccesarily global state, but we refactored to be an actual object,
# although there's still a default global one used, with class methods
# that delegate to it, for backwards compat and convenience. 
#
# By default, a ServiceStore loads service definitions from 
# Rails.root/config/umlaut_services.yml . Although in testing,
# or for future architectural expansion, services can be manually supplied
# instead. 
#
# A ServiceStore instantiates services from definitions, by id, 
# ServiceStore.instantiate_service!("our_sfx")
#
# A ServiceStore's cached service definitions can be reset, useful in
# testing:  ServiceStore.reset!
#
# They'll then be lazily reloaded on next access, unless manually set.
