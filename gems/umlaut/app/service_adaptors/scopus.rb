# Service adapter plug-in.
#
# NOTE: This is based on deprecated Scopus API's, Scopus will take them
# away 31 December 2014. Please see scopus2.rb instead which uses
# new Scopus API's. 
# 
# PURPOSE: Includes "cited by", "similar articles" and "more by these authors"
# links from scopus. Also will throw in an abstract from Scopus if found. 
#
# LIMTATIONS: You must be a Scopus customer for these links generated to work
# for your users at all! Off-campus users should be going through ezproxy, see
# the EZProxy plug-in.
# Must find a match in scopus, naturally. "cited by" will only
# be included if Scopus has non-0 "cited by" links. But there's no good way
# to precheck similar/more-by for this, so they are provided blind and may
# result in 0 hits.  You can turn them off if you like, with @include_similar,
# and @include_more_by_authors. 
#
# REGISTERING:  This plug in actually has to use two seperate Scopus APIs.
# For the first, the scopus 'json' search api, you must regsiter and get an
# api key from scopus, which you can do here:
# http://searchapi.scopus.com
# Then include as @json_api_key in service config.
#
# For the second Scopus API, you theoretically need a Scopus "PartnerID" and
# corresponding "release number", in @partner_id and @scopus_release
# There's no real easy way to get one. Scopus says:
#    "To obtain a partner ID or release number, contact your nearest regional
#    Scopus office. A list of Scopus contacts is available at
#    http://www.info.scopus.com/contactus/index.shtml"
# Bah! But fortunately, using the "partnerID" assigned to the Scopus Json
# API, 65, _seems_ to work, and is coded here as the default. You could try
# going with that. When you register a partnerID, you also get a 'salt key',
# which is currently not used by this code, but @link_salt_key is reserved
# for it in case added functionality does later.
