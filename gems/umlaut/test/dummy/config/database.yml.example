# Umlaut dumm app database.yml.example. 
#
# Copy this file to database.yml and configure
# for your environment, in order to run tests, or run the dummy application.

#
# You must fill out connection details for the 'test' database
# below to run Umlaut tests:
#
# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as a development or production db.

test:
  adapter: mysql2
  pool: 5 
  database: your_database_name
  username: umlaut
  password: your_database_password
  host: your.database.host

# Above is the minimum you need to do to run tests, you can just
# go and run them now. 

# There is some Umlaut functionality that runs directly
# against an SFX db, and to test it, we need a mock DB that
# looks like SFX.  Definining this `sfx_db` database is
# optional, if you don't define it those tests just
# won't be run, which is fine unless you know you want to run them. 
# Travis will catch them anyway. 
#
# If you do want to run tests against it, uncomment and
# configure, with mock_instance: true. 
#
# Do NOT point this at a real SFX db, running the tests
# WILL alter the database. 

# sfx_db:
#   adapter: mysql2
#   database: your_database_name
#   username: umlaut
#   password: your_database_password
#   host: your.database.host
#   # :mock_instance is used for SFX search testing.
#   # DO NOT SET :mock_instance TO TRUE FOR ANYTHING LIKE A REAL SFX DATABASE.
#   # If in doubt set :mock_instance => false
#   mock_instance: true






# Sometimes it can be convenient to start up the included
# dummy app and interact with it in a browser etc. Definining
# a development database may be useful for that scenario, but
# is not needed for testing. 

development:
  adapter: mysql2
  pool: 10
  database: your_database_name
  username: umlaut
  password: your_database_password
  host: your.database.host





# There should ordinarily be no reason to define a production 
# db in this dummy app
# production:
#  <<: *dev
#  database: umlaut3_prod
