Migrations that are ordinarily created in an Umlaut-enabled app are 
_not_ included here in this test/dummy app used for testing. 

In a Rails plugin gem, Rails db:migrate seems to be able to use
the migrations from the actual gem itself, in the gem source
./db/migrate, and if they are doubly included here, we get
duplicate migration errors trying to db:migrate. 

We do have one migration in here, to create the mock SFX database for testing,
something an ordinary real Umlaut app does not do.
